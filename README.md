The file contains my project related to the Stratascratch exercise: https://platform.stratascratch.com/data-projects/delivery-duration-prediction.
I have personally decided to use a train and validation set (the latter was created from the first after pre-processing) in order to obtain a first evaluation of the model. 
For a more complete performance evaluation a test set should be used.
